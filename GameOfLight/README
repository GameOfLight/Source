Experimental library version combining both HW and simulator implementation into the same library.

To use with arduino:
1. Copy folder to <your-arduino-folder>/libraries/
2. If you wish to use the Sim variant you may start using it at this point.

3. For HW version of the functions "#define GameOfLightHW" in your scetch
4. Start using the HW library.
5. Realize the Arduino preprosessor made a big mess and you've now got both libraries running
6. Fail.
